# Track 1 — Rotten data-layer artifacts (ranked by impact)

> **⚠️ INVALIDATION — 2026-05-23 21:30 PDT.** Finding #1 below (`aggregate_meta_daily_insights` RPC historical-windows broken) is **invalidated**. The Phase 1 diagnostic ([../../plans/2026-05-23-phase-1-execution/01-diagnostic.md](../../plans/2026-05-23-phase-1-execution/01-diagnostic.md)) proved the apparent discrepancies were a pagination bug in the audit tool itself (`reconcile-meta-ads-data.mjs` paginated without ORDER BY → unstable row order across paged queries → some rows double-counted, others gapped). Audit tool fixed in `5988ccc`. After the fix, all previously-failing windows PASS deterministically.
>
> **The RPC is correct. The data is correct. No data-layer rebuild is needed.**
>
> The remaining "Pending entries" at the bottom (per-dashboard bespoke checks) are also de-prioritized — the systemic correctness concern that motivated them was a false positive.

Impact = (number of red metric-mismatches caused) × (severity of those mismatches) × (reach across dashboards).

## 1. `aggregate_meta_daily_insights` RPC — historical windows broken

- **Location:** `supabase/migrations/20260522120000_aggregate_meta_insights_environment_scope.sql:12-115` (latest definition)
- **Called from:** `src/lib/meta-insight-aggregates.ts:132` via `aggregateMetaInsights()` wrapper
- **Drives:** /analyst (the canonical performance dashboard) and likely /analysis (Ask AI dashboards)
- **Mismatch count:** **429 metric-mismatches** across 3 historical windows tested (178 in Q1 2026, 176 in 2025, 75 in 2024)
- **Magnitude:** 3% to 50%+ error in spend/impressions/clicks/leads/conversions, in BOTH directions depending on the entity
- **Recency boundary:** Last ~30 days pass; everything older fails
- **Root cause (high confidence):** environment-scope predicates on metadata joins (`brands`, `meta_campaigns`, `meta_ad_sets`, `meta_ads`) drop historical rows where joined metadata has NULL or mismatched `environment`, and multiply rows where multiple env-scoped metadata candidates exist
- **Suggested fix shape (two options):**
  1. **Backfill:** populate `environment = 'production'` on every existing `brands`/`meta_campaigns`/`meta_ad_sets`/`meta_ads` row that lacks it. One-shot UPDATE per table, then re-run reconciliation. Low risk if the env value is missing rather than wrong.
  2. **RPC rewrite:** treat `meta_daily_insights.environment` as authoritative. Don't require joined metadata to also have matching env — leave that as a sync-time invariant. Simpler join, faster query, retroactively correct.
- **Confidence:** **high** (deterministic reproduction via existing reconciliation script; pattern of both undercount and overcount mechanically consistent with the join hypothesis)
- **Severity for rebuild decision:** historical analysis (year-over-year, Q-over-Q, "compare to last quarter") is silently wrong on the dashboard the user spends the most time on. AI reports/chat that pull historical windows inherit the same wrong numbers. **This is THE finding.**
- **Is a full rebuild required?** **No.** This is fixable in place with a backfill or RPC rewrite. C-scope (data-layer rebuild) at most; arguably D-scope (targeted fix).
